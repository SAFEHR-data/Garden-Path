Azure Machine Learning (AML) is a cloud-based service within the Azure ecosystem that provides tools and services to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. It offers a collaborative environment for data scientists and developers, allowing them to leverage pre-built algorithms, manage data, and use compute resources efficiently. AML streamlines the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, making it easier to develop, experiment, and operationalize AI solutions at scale.
