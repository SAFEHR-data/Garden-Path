You are likely to need the following tools and services

## Tools
Installed tools:

- [Azure Data Studio](./20_setup_ads.qmd)
- [VS Code](./20_setup_vscode.qmd)
- [Conda](./20_setup_conda.qmd)

Access to Services:

- [Virtual Machine](./20_setup_vm.qmd)
- [Gitea](./20_setup_gitea.qmd)
- [Azure Machine Learning](./20_setup_aml.qmd)
- [FlowEHR feature store](../anatomy/feature_store.qmd)



How to set-up FlowEHR on Azure:

See the [onboarding for the data scientist](../personas/datascientist/onboarding.qmd) docs for more details

- You will be working from your laptop, and interacting through a browser (e.g. Edge, Chrome etc.)
- Ask your FlowEHR administrator for access to the Azure TRE landing zone. They will provide you with a link to the landing page, and add your NHS.net credentials to the list of approved users.
  - Login using your NHS.net email. You will need to have 2-factor authentication enabled
  - Set-up a virtual machine from one of the provided templates. Details  in the Azure TRE [docs](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/v0.9.0/using-tre/tre-for-research/using-vms/)
- Inbound and outbound traffic to the TRE is strictly controlled so you will find the following services to enable you to work
    - a [mirror](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/v0.9.0/tre-templates/shared-services/nexus/) of Python (via Conda, and PyPi), R and other package managers provided by [Nexus](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/)
    - an [internal Git server](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/v0.9.0/tre-templates/shared-services/gitea/) provided by [Gitea](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/)
    - an [airlock](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/v0.9.0/tre-templates/shared-services/airlock-notifier/) for moving items into and out from the TRE. Local polices will enforce controls to protect data, and the environment.

You should find yourself with a suite of open source tools designed for modern data science tasks, including:

- Jupyter
- RStudio
- Integrated Development Environments (e.g. PyCharm) and text editors (e.g. VS Code)
- A database GUI
