title: Gitea set-up

You will need a username and password for the TRE hosted Gitea instance.
Now go to https://gitea-uclhtreprod.azurewebsites.net/ from a browser in the TRE.

Log on

You'll also want to run 

```sh
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email 
```

with your Github identity, so that you're commits are written with your real github handle

And to save you having to re-enter your username and password on every interaction with Gitea then

```sh
git config --global credential.helper store
```
