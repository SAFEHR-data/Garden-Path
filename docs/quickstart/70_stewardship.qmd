Models should not be deployed without a monitoring strategy. To this end, we provide a [template](https://github.com/SAFEHR-data/Model-Seedling) that addresses _data drift_ and _model drift_. These steps are in addition to the data testing that is built into the feature engineering pipeline.

## Key terms

- [Ground Truth](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/17839/what-is-ground-truth): the true answer
- [Predicted or Inferred value or label](): the model or the machines best guess
- Training data: a sufficient sample of the training data set used compare against the new (unseen) data
- Unseen data: data that has arrived after the model has been trained and deployed. The data in production.
