The skills you need

- Familiarity with **Python** programming for data science tasks. Much of the design of the platform is orientated to support those with strong SQL skills, or those with strong R skills, but for now you will find that the examples and the work are biased toward Python.

The permissions you need

- We assume that you are working in a _direct care_ role and therefore have rights to access identifiable data.

The resources you need

- Some time and some patience!
