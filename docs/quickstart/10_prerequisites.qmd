title: Prerequisites for FlowEHR
---

## The skills you need

- Familiarity with **Python** programming for data science tasks. Much of the design of the platform is orientated to support those with strong SQL skills, or those with strong R skills, but for now you will find that the examples and the work are biased toward Python.

## The permissions you need

- We assume that you are working in a _direct care_ role and therefore have rights to access identifiable data.

## The resources you need

- Some time and some patience!

## Recommendations

We're not _telling_ you to do the following, but these are the sort of things you might want to consider if you hit problems.

- Try using Microsoft Edge as your browser for working with the TRE. It just seems to work better with this tooling.
- Pay attention to the two-factor authentication. You're likely to end up with more than one. At the minumum, you'll have one for NHS.net and you'll need one for the TRE (e.g. https://uclhtredev.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com/)


It's going to get confusing at times. There's a lot of new terminology. Please check-out the [FAQ](../faq/faq.qmd).
