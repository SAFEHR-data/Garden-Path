title: Connections and Authentication
---

You will need to make the following connections.

- to the source database (if your are building features)
- to the Feature Store
- to Azure Machine Learning
- to synthetic data (if you are working outside the TRE perhaps as an application developer)
- to the application database (CosmosDB)

## Connecting to the source data

## Connecting Azure Machine Learning

## Accessing Synthetic Data

1. We have built a tool ([Satellite](https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/Satellite)) that streams structually correct but semantically meaningless data for the purposes of development.
2. We have collaborated with colleagues at the Alan Turing Institute, and have used their [SQLSynthGen](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sqlsynthgen) tool to create a replica of data.
