title: 'Building a FlowEHR App'
---

If you want to build an app that works safely with live patient data and/or ML Model predictions, share it securely with clinicians to inform their decision-making, and you don't want to worry about managing any infrastructure and deployment logic, then you're in the right place.

> You can read more about the anatomy of FlowEHR apps [here](../../anatomy/apps.qmd).

> This page is currently under development. In the meantime, please check out the [quickstart to app development!](../../quickstart/60_deployment.qmd)
