We deploy FlowEHR in different 'environments', to suit the needs of our different personas.

- `prod`: The production environment is where the fully-functional and tested FlowEHR application is deployed for end-users. The environment contains real-world data and can be optimised for performance and reliability.

- `app-dev`: The application-development environment is designed for developers. It has a synthetic version of the feature store, generated by [Satellite](https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/Satellite), and transformed using the same [data pipeline](https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/FlowEHR-Data-Pot) as used in `prod`uction.

- `ml-dev`: The machine-learning development environment is designed for data scientists and machine learning engineers. They can access live patient data to prototype and test new models, before deployment to `prod`uction.
